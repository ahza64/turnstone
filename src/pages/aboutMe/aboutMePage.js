    To quickly encapsulate the things I enjoyed and grew from in my childhood that impacts my adulthood and professionalism today. (Not to be too corporate, but…) let's take a look at easily relatable begginnings that lead to greater things; Star Wars, Ninja Turtles, and Legos. Being the philosopher I seem to have always been, older Star Wars lore had a great appeal to me and may have been the strongest influence on me to seeking truth and harmony in the nature of things and the beginnings of buddhism and later Western Philosophy to help me navigate the complexities of self and direction within the real tangible world we exsist in. Ninja Turtles was the beginning of what it means to me, to be a team player and sometimes challenge the brotherhood bond against ethics, morals and honor. Legos, on the other hand, had the greatest impact on my tangible professional career. I’ve always liked taking things apart and putting them back together. A computer’s hardware falls into these tangible things, but what a computer creates, the software, are just imaginary (digital) “things” you take apart and put back together, and ever since I wired up my first relay, I’ve been thoroughly enjoying it. It just took me a while to get over my “tough guy” mindset about needing to use my body to earn a living.

    <p>this whole page is a joke, like we did in WDI, basic info list as a joke. hieght, weight, hair color, eye color, ...skin type, lol </p>
    <p> Aspire to work in data arechterure and design. I love "game theory" and resource management.
    Like many, I want to build video games... But I want to design and archetect games.
    Independent of marketing scams and gimmicks. So, a dream of owning my own, wildly popular, and unsuccessful gaming publishing company.
    But to feed myself, I aspire to to more data visualisations and aggreagations for tangible items and logistical resources.
    I grew up outside a lot, similar to a boyscout, but never joined the scouts for religious resons.
    A real adventurer and harlot. </p>
