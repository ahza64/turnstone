  Full stack web developer, consistently finding himself falling into leadership roles through building productive and motivated social workflows utilizing compassion, understanding and empathy to find compromise within a team when needed.
  With a background in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB aggregation, and React/React Hooks, this multifaceted man will most likely add functionality you didn't expect. Full-stack is a balance between my passion for algorithm development on the back end and creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interaction on the front.
  I come from a family of creative types and have a lot of experience in the design and production of actual products in use. A family that always has projects going. Design comes like a second language. End-to-end design speciality with a new found focus on front end.
