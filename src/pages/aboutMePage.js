    <p>swoop in sky diving picture with css trasitions like the icons and throbbing on the home page</p>
    <p>this whole page is a joke, like we did in WDI, basic info list as a joke. hieght, weight, hair color, eye color, ...skin type, lol </p>
    <p> Aspire to work in data arechterure and design. I love "game theory" and resource management.
    Like many, I want to build video games... But I want to design and archetect games.
    Independent of marketing scams and gimmicks. So, a dream of owning my own, wildly popular, and unsuccessful gaming publishing company.
    But to feed myself, I aspire to to more data visualisations and aggreagations for tangible items and logistical resources.
    I grew up outside a lot, similar to a boyscout, but never joined the scouts for religious resons.
    A real adventurer and harlot. </p>
